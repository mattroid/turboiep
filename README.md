## Turbo IEP

### This project aims to solve the problems with creating IEP's 

  * IEP's are time consuming
  * IEP's can be difficult to match up against state standards
  * IEP's lack cohesion of data collected on students and their goals

### Features

By answering profiling questions on a student, we can take care of some of the leg work or boiler plate information needed to get a student's IEP going with accurate information. It's important to remember that this is not a tool to replace the IEP process, but instead to assist in IEP writing. 

  * Get a useful summary description of the student
  * Get a set of recomended IEP goals for the student
  * Provide a platform for tracking progress on goals
